# Welcome to the Minimal Design Blog Site 

I created this blog site using React JS, Next.js, Tailwind CSS, GraphQL, and GraphCMS, which are all awesome technologies that make it easy to build amazing web applications.

If you're interested in learning more about how I built this site, I followed a [tutorial video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HYv55DhgTuA) that you can check out.

This site features a minimal design, which I hope you find both elegant and simple to use.

## Tech Stack

Here are some of the technologies I used to build this site:

- React JS - A JavaScript library that is specialized in creating UI.
- Next.js - A framework for React applications that supports server-side rendering.
- Tailwind CSS - A utility-based CSS framework that allows you to easily create styles for components.
- GraphQL - A query language used for fetching data between the client and the server.
- GraphCMS - A headless CMS that allows you to fetch content using GraphQL.

## Setup

Setting up this site on your local machine is easy. Follow the steps below:

### Installation
Clone this project to your local machine.
Install dependencies by running the following command:

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

### Create a GraphCMS Schema
Before starting the development server, you need to create a **GraphCMS schema** and add some content to it. Don't worry, it's easier than it sounds! You can follow the steps in [this tutorial video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HYv55DhgTuA&t=467s) to create a GraphCMS schema for your blog site.

### Environment Variable Setup
To fetch data from GraphCMS, you'll need to set up environment variables. Specifically, you'll need to create a **.ENV file** and set your GraphCMS API token. Please refer to [this tutorial video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HYv55DhgTuA&t=3085s) for instructions on how to set up environment variables.

### Start Development Server
To start the development server, run the following command:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

That's it. You're all set to start exploring the Minimal Design Blog Site. EnjoyÔººüòåÔºè
